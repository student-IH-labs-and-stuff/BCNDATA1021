# Lab | Tableau Guided Analysis with Stories

Build a story compiled of individual captioned storypoints in Tableau and publish the story only to your tableau public account, in order to submit the url via the Student Portal. 

Utilise the annotation and duplicate storypoint features within the Story to guide the end user through the story you want to tell with your data.  For each page of your story you should consider data visualisation best practices. The chart choices for each story point are up to you and be as simple or complex as you like but keep in mind that the Story is ideally consumed as a semi interactive presentation. Its ok also to include some visual imagery, external research and comments but the main focus should be on visualising observations found in the data, step by step. 

(Ensure each chart has the appropriate fit, mark type, title, axis labels and legend and that visual best practices have been considered) 


## Your challenge : 

Using the data set [Harvested_Crops_Summary.csv](Harvested_Crops_Summary.csv) 
and Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public, create a Story (at least 5 story points, but you can add more!) to take end users through the following or a similar / customised narrative: 

* 1 - overall summary / introduction to your Story
* 2 - a view of a crop(s) over time or with all locations to provide context for what your Story will cover
* 3-  a view revealing comparisons / trends over time, within the crop harvest data: pick at least 1 relationship or trend to drill into. 
This can mean focusing on one or multiple crops, one or multiple areas of the world, over all time or filtering to specific points in time, comparing your choice of measurable data : area or yield or production. The aim is to discover some interesting patterns but also ensure you understand what you are looking at on each page of the story - this data set can be confusing and I recommend you spend some time exploring and making sense of what you see, perhaps even validating the numbers with external research. 
  for example : 
  - the total ha area harvested of pulses, over time,  overlaid with production tonnage of pulses, comparison between Americas and Africa. If I displayed this data on two pages of my Story I would have 2 sets of two timeseries, which first cross for Americas in 1998 but have not yet converged for Africa. This is presumably because of intensified farming methods in the Americas. 
* 4- a view which is related to the last view, but draws attention to an area, a period of time, points of note or surprising trends, drilling into what was showed on the previous page in some way.
* 5- what do you want the end user to remember about your story (conclusion / main findings)



The dataset for this lab is taken from a makeover monday challenge earlier this month (14.03) which means you will find lots of examples online via twitter and tableau public of tableau workbooks that other commnunity users have built, as well as videos on the top examples and a viz along video too. 
A lot of what you might discover may be advanced for you but will definitely give you some ideas for what your story could contain and what chart types to use. 
Follow this path and go to 14.03 : https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/
